Pre-Implementation Notes

Proposed Modifications
- Initialize Git repository and ensure the default branch is `main`.
- Create an isolated Python virtual environment (`.venv`).
- Add baseline documentation files: `CHANGELOG.md`, `dev_scratchpad.md`, `requirements.txt`.
- Configure remote origin to the GitHub repository.
- Perform initial commit and push to the `main` branch.

Justification
- Establishes foundational version control and documentation per internal protocol.
- Isolated environment mitigates system contamination and dependency conflicts.
- Baseline docs provide immediate clarity and a durable audit trail.

Impact and Risk Analysis
- Minimal operational risk; repository initialization and documentation are non-breaking.
- Authentication issues may block initial push; mitigated by using HTTPS and valid credentials.
- Excluding `.venv` avoids large binary commits and keeps history clean.
