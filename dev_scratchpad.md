Pre-Implementation Notes

Proposed Modifications
- Initialize Git repository and ensure the default branch is `main`.
- Create an isolated Python virtual environment (`.venv`).
- Add baseline documentation files: `CHANGELOG.md`, `dev_scratchpad.md`, `requirements.txt`.
- Configure remote origin to the GitHub repository.
- Perform initial commit and push to the `main` branch.

Justification
- Establishes foundational version control and documentation per internal protocol.
- Isolated environment mitigates system contamination and dependency conflicts.
- Baseline docs provide immediate clarity and a durable audit trail.

Impact and Risk Analysis
- Minimal operational risk; repository initialization and documentation are non-breaking.
- Authentication issues may block initial push; mitigated by using HTTPS and valid credentials.
- Excluding `.venv` avoids large binary commits and keeps history clean.

Summary
- Scaffolded FastAPI ingestion service, Google/AWS client wrappers, and LangGraph-based analysis Lambda.
- Implemented secure OAuth token handling with encryption, Google Drive/Sheets uploads, and asynchronous job orchestration via SQS + DynamoDB.
- Integrated Gemini for structured trade analysis, audio transcription, and chart vision; added optional SerpAPI research.
- Introduced retry/backoff utilities, Makefile + Ruff linting, GitHub Actions CI, and comprehensive documentation covering schema/output.

Implementation Notes
- Created configuration, clients, dependencies, services, and API routes under `app/`, exposing trade ingestion, OAuth, and analysis job endpoints.
- Added `agents/analysis_lambda/` package containing LangGraph workflow, Gemini toolchain, AWS bootstrap, and DynamoDB persistence of structured/markdown reports.
- Implemented token encryption via Fernet, Google Drive/Sheets wrappers using OAuth credentials, and retry-capable download helpers.
- Built WebSearch client (SerpAPI), Gemini client with JSON-only prompts, and analysis tools that normalize multimodal insights.
- Added Terraform IaC stubs, README sections on setup, API usage, operational notes, and report schema; appended CHANGELOG entries.
- Established Makefile targets (`lint`, `test`, `ci`), `.ruff.toml`, and a GitHub Actions workflow running lint/tests plus `terraform validate`.
- Expanded pytest suite with token/attachment/transcription tests leveraging stubs for deterministic verification.

Rationale
- Providing structured JSON + Markdown outputs enables downstream dashboards to consume machine-friendly data while still rendering human-readable summaries.
- Retry logic around Drive/SerpAPI mitigates transient network/API quota failures without overcomplicating the workflow.
- CI automation and linting catch regressions early and document the expected contributor workflow.
- Encryption of refresh tokens and centralized credential management protect user data while supporting async processing.

Pre-Implementation Notes

Observed Issue
- Running `make install` failed to install `google-generativeai==0.5.2` due to an outdated `pip` (19.2.3) on the host environment. The error indicated no matching distribution despite known availability of newer releases.

Proposed Modifications
- Enforce isolated virtual environment usage by updating the `Makefile` to:
  - Create a `.venv` if absent.
  - Upgrade `pip` within `.venv` before installing dependencies.
  - Use `.venv/bin/pip` to install pinned requirements.
- Keep `requirements.txt` unchanged initially; rely on modern `pip` and wheel support to resolve `google-generativeai==0.5.2`.
- If installation still fails, consider adjusting `google-generativeai` to a compatible version verified under Python 3.8 (fallback only if required).

Justification
- Aligns with the mandatory requirement to conduct all development in an isolated virtual environment.
- Upgrading `pip` addresses packaging metadata and wheel resolution issues common with modern packages using `pyproject.toml` and PEP 517.
- Minimizes changes to pinned dependencies unless compatibility requires it, preserving reproducibility.

Impact and Risk Analysis
- Low operational risk: Makefile changes are straightforward and constrained to developer workflow commands.
- Compatibility considerations: `google-generativeai` may require newer Python versions in later releases; current pin (0.5.2) is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8, but we will verify.
- Failure modes: If `.venv` creation or `pip` upgrade fails, installation will halt; mitigation includes clear logging and rerun instructions.
- Outcome validation: After implementation, run `make install` and `make test` within `.venv` to confirm integrity.

Impact and Risk Analysis
- Gemini/SerpAPI usage may incur costs; operational notes and optional configuration help control exposure.
- Structured JSON parsing reduces report ambiguity but requires downstream clients to handle schema evolution (documented in README).
- Retry loops cap attempts to avoid runaway executions; further batching/caching can be explored if latency becomes a concern.
